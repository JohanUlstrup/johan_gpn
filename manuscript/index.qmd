# DNA language models are powerful predictors of genome-wide variant effects

The idea for this project was to evaluate the Genome-Pretrained Network (GPN) introduced in [@Kantorovitz2024] and determine whether it could achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods in predicting genome-wide variant effects.

The model is designed as a convolutional neural network (CNN) and takes input sequences with a window size of 512. During training, 15% of the positions within each window are masked to enable the model to learn meaningful representations.

The architecture consists of 25 layers, each structured as follows: a dilated convolution layer, followed by an add-and-norm layer with a skip connection from before the dilated convolution. This is followed by a feedforward layer, another add-and-norm layer, and additional skip connections.

A feedforward layer is a fundamental component of neural networks, where inputs pass through one or more fully connected layers with activation functions, transforming data without looping back. This structure helps the model learn complex representations by applying weighted transformations and non-linearities.

A dilated convolution expands the receptive field of a convolutional layer without increasing the number of parameters or reducing resolution. By spacing kernel elements apart, it captures long-range dependencies in sequences, making it particularly useful in genomic data analysis. When combined, dilated convolutions and feedforward layers enhance a modelâ€™s ability to recognize patterns across different scales efficiently.

After passing through the 25 layers, the model produces a contextual embedding with a dimension of 512 (D=512), followed by classification layers. The final layer outputs the probabilities of the four nucleotides at each masked position.

The GPN variant effect prediction score is calculated as the log-likelihood ratio between the alternate (ALT) and reference (REF) alleles. Here, L represents the window length in base pairs, and D denotes the embedding dimension.

# cromatin structure and regulatiopn of genes
2. Regulation of Gene Expression
The chromatin state influences gene accessibility:

Open chromatin is associated with active gene transcription.

Closed chromatin represses gene activity.
Repetitive elements near regulatory genes can shift chromatin structure, acting as silencers or enhancers depending on the epigenetic landscape (Venkatesh & Workman, 2015).

1. Genome Stability and Repression of Transposable Elements
Repetitive sequences, such as LINEs, SINEs, and satellite DNA, are often silenced via heterochromatin formation. This closed chromatin state is essential to suppress transposable elements, which can otherwise mobilize and disrupt genome integrity (Moazed, 2011).

Makova & Hardison (2015) â€“ The effects of chromatin organization on variation in mutation rates
Nature Reviews Genetics
Discusses how heterochromatin protects repeats but also contributes to mutational heterogeneity.


4. Development and Cell Differentiation
During development, regions with repetitive DNA undergo reconfiguration. The switch from euchromatin to heterochromatin is essential for cell lineage specification, and misregulation can cause developmental disorders (Gelato & Fischle, 2008).

### Three-dimensional genome reorganization during mouse spermatogenesis
- Highlights how A/B compartment transitions coincide with major cell state transitions during spermatogenesis.
- Found TF motifs and simple repeats enriched in switching regions.
- Sheds light on regulatory elements linked to chromatin phase switching.

 Core Findings
This study investigates how the 3D organization of the genome changes across seven sequential stages of mouse spermatogenesis, using Hi-C technology. The work specifically focuses on topologically associating domains (TADs), chromatin loops, and A/B compartments, revealing highly dynamic reorganization events.

ðŸ§© 1. TAD and Loop Dynamics
Present in Type A spermatogonia (early stage).

Disappear at pachytene stage (meiosis I prophase).

Reappear in mature spermatozoa.

This pattern indicates that TADs are not static during development and may not be essential for transcription at all stages.

ðŸ§· 2. CTCF Binding
CTCF remains bound at TAD boundary regions even when TADs are absent (e.g., in pachytene spermatocytes).

This suggests CTCF binding is not sufficient by itself to maintain 3D structure.

ðŸ”¥ 3. Enhancers, Promoters, and Active Transcription
Despite the absence of TADs at pachytene, enhancers and promoters retain open chromatin.

Transcription continues, implying that gene expression can occur independently of higher-order chromatin loops.

ðŸ§­ 4. A/B Compartment Changes
A/B compartments are largely conserved on autosomes throughout spermatogenesis.

However, specific A â†” B switching events are correlated with changes in gene activity.

The X chromosome loses its A/B compartment structure during stages like pachytene spermatocytes (pacSC), round spermatids (rST), and elongating spermatids (eST).

 Repeats and Chromatin Compartment Transitions
TF motif enrichment was analyzed in differentially active chromatin regions, which also included repetitive DNA content.

During A/B compartment switching, particularly in regions transitioning from B (closed) to A (open), some simple and low-complexity repeats were enriched, suggesting a role in:

Regulatory rewiring during cell fate transition.

Chromatin accessibility and transcription activation.

The X chromosome, which undergoes massive reorganization and loss of A/B compartment structure during specific stages (pacSC, rST, eST), may exhibit a distinct repeat signature, though this was only briefly hinted at in the paper.

### Single-cell long-read Hi-C, scNanoHi-C2
- Uses single-cell Hi-C to resolve chromatin changes in early germ cells.
- Finds TE subfamilies enriched differently in A/B compartments, suggesting a regulatory function of repeat elements.

ðŸ”¬ Key Findings Summary
Development of scNanoHi-C2

The authors introduce scNanoHi-C2, a novel single-cell long-read Hi-C technique.

It overcomes limitations of standard Hi-C by capturing long-range, multi-contact chromatin interactions in individual cells.

3D Genome Dynamics in Germ Cells

Applied to embryonic germline cells, the technique reveals:

Stage-specific topological reorganization of the genome.

Highly dynamic A/B compartment transitions, even at early embryonic stages.

Repeat Element Profiling

The study shows distinct enrichment patterns of transposable elements (TEs) in A and B compartments.

LINEs and SINEs were differentially represented, correlating with developmental chromatin remodeling.

These repeats may contribute to insulation, compartmental identity, or nuclear architecture.

Chromatin Rewiring during Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) Development

Early embryonic germ cells exhibit weaker TAD boundaries and less stable compartments compared to somatic cells.

As differentiation progresses, compartment strength increases, indicating a progressive maturation of 3D genome organization.

X Chromosome Inactivation Patterns

The paper provides high-resolution views of X chromosome organization, noting changes in compartmental asymmetry and pairing during early germ cell development.

### 3D genome remodeling and homologous pairing during meiotic prophase
- Simple and LINE repeats enriched in B compartments, involved in meiotic structural integrity.


Key Findings Summary
This study integrates Hi-C chromatin conformation capture with super-resolution microscopy to uncover how 3D genome architecture is remodeled during meiotic prophase I in both male and female germlines (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) in mice.

Homologous Chromosome Pairing
Chromosomes exhibit precise and progressive pairing during prophase I.

The study captures early pairing events in spermatocytes and oocytes, using high-resolution contact maps.

Contact frequency increases significantly in homologous regions during zygotene and pachytene stages.

2. Chromatin Compartment Remodeling
A/B compartments are weakened or restructured during prophase.

Specific B compartments, enriched in LINE elements and heterochromatin, show elevated pairing dynamics.

Suggests B compartment flexibility supports pairing more than A.

3. Role of Repeat Elements
Repeat-rich regions, especially LINEs and LTRs, are preferentially localized to B compartments and correlate with stronger interhomolog interactions.

Repeats may play a structural role in mediating nuclear architecture during meiosis.

4. Sex Differences in Chromosome Pairing
The authors find distinct dynamics between male and female germ cells, including:

Differences in compartment switching speed.

Asynchronous timing in homolog pairing progression.

Oocytes retain more stable open chromatin than spermatocytes during mid-prophase.
